## 📌 About the Project

This repository was created to **practice data structures in C#** as part of the **Data Structures** course in the Software Engineering program.

## 🎯 Goals

The main objective is to apply and reinforce key concepts such as:

- Lists (`Append`, `Prepend`, `Insert`, `Remove`, `RemoveAt`, `Contains`)
- Queues
- Stacks
- Deques
- Sorting and searching algorithms *(in progress)*
- Hash tables *(in progress)*

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Hospital-XD/Aps pt2`: Team project simulating a medical service system using queues, lists, and stacks.
- `APS_MenuEstruturasDados/`: Interactive menu showcasing examples and tests for various data structures.
- **Individual practice folders**: Contain exercises and experiments focused on logic, data structures, and C# programming fundamentals.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **Visual Studio**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
